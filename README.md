# Movie-Plot-Word-Cloud-Generator
This project uses a dataset of movie plots from Wikipedia to create visual word clouds that highlight the most frequent words used in plot descriptions for movies directed by a specific filmmaker. It's a great way to explore thematic patterns and storytelling elements across a director's filmography.
